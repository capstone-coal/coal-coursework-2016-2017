\begin{abstract}
Mountain-top Mining is a method of surface mining primarily used for exploiting coal seams in the land that is known to be extremely destructive to mountain landscapes as well as streams and watersheds, particularly in the Appalachian region of the United States. Other areas of the United States also practice similarly destructive surface mining practices in search of metals, minerals, and even radioactive materials. This project delivers COAL - Coal and Open-pit mining impacts on American Lands - a suite of algorithms that identify, classify, and quantify the impacts of surface mining in the continental United States.
