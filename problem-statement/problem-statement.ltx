\section*{\bf{Abstrac}t}
Mountain-top Mining (MTM) is a method of open surface mining with the primary
aim of exploring and exploiting coal seams present within the land and
solid earth (LSE) on mountaintops. Amongst other surface mining activities,
MTM is known to be an extremely destructive mining procedure predominantly
limited to the spatial boundaries of the Southern Appalachians (Eastern Kentucky,
West Virginia and very small sections of Virginia and Tennessee). MTM
is known to have caused irreparable damage to mountain landscapes and signifi-
cant immediate and longer-term damage to key streams and watersheds. Larger
afield, the rest of the U.S.A has some extensive surface mining in various places
for exploitation of resources such as gravel/sand, various metals, other minerals
and even radioactive materials, etc. Several studies have provided important
scientific understanding related to the local, regional and state-level impacts of
such environmentally destructive practices, however a similar understanding on
the national and continental levels are very much lacking.
This project will deliver COAL - Coal and Open-pit surface mining impacts
on American Lands - a suite of algorithms to identify, classify, characterize, and
quantify (by reporting a number of key metrics) the direct and indirect impacts
of MTM and related destructive surface mining activities across the continental
U.S (and further afield).

\section*{\bf{Project Objectives}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Work with the NASA JPL team to utilize imagery from satellites such as
Landsat 5, 7 and 8 to build a suite of imagery processing algorithms that
identify mining activity across the U.S. dating from 1980 to present. Examples
of such activity are located within the central Appalachian regions
of the eastern United States where the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) estimated 2,200 square miles (5,700 km2) of Appalachian
forests were cleared for MTM sites by the year 2012, with over 500 mountaintops
being destroyed due to MTM activity;

\item  Eventually, enable improved accuracy of correlations between proximity 
of MTM activities to streams, rivers, estuaries, etc. through use of hydrology,
dam and reservoir datasets such as the Global Reservoir and
Dam Database (GRaND) and other water system datasets. EPA impact
statements have found that streams in valley filling from MTM-affected
watersheds contain higher levels of minerals in the water and decreased
aquatic biodiversity. Mine-affected streams also have high selenium concentrations,
which can bioaccumulate and produce toxic effects (e.g., reproductive
failure, physical deformity, mortality), and affect reservoirs
below such streams; and

\item Provide a baseline suite of reporting metrics which will appropriately rank
and document the changes within LSE areas and hydrological waterways
as observed over time; finally (iv) extend COAL as a set of reusable components
which can be used in cloud-based platforms such as Mapboxs
Landsat-live or NASA Ames Stereo pipeline, amongst others.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{\bf{Project Deliverables}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Based on the development one or more appealing usage scenarios; develop
and deliver a working architecture and systems engineering document that
defines the scope of the COAL software suite.

\item  Provide a schedule of works that defines milestones and timelines for
achieving 1 above.

\item Deliver on subtasks which address parallel development of
\begin{enumerate}
\item A suite of imagery processing algorithms that identify, classify, characterize,
and quantify mining activity across the U.S. dating from
1980 to present.

\item Tests for such algorithms

\item An interactive, self sustaining Website which will be updated with
imagery exposing and highlighting the destructive nature of the mining
activities detailed earlier within this document.
